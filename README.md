Through the development of this gift management system, I have gained extensive knowledge of Java Collections Framework and File I/O operations. I learned how to implement and manipulate various data structures, including Stacks for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) gift processing, Queues for managing pending orders, and ArrayLists for dynamic storage. I mastered the use of the Comparable interface to define custom sorting logic, allowing me to use Collections.sort() to rank products by price. Furthermore, I practiced essential File Management techniques, including creating text files, writing structured data using FileWriter, and reading content with the Scanner class. This project also strengthened my ability to handle Exception Handling using try-catch blocks to manage potential I/O errors and solidified my understanding of how to bridge the gap between in-memory data structures and persistent storage on a hard drive.
